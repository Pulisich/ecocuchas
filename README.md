# Eco-Cuchas main site

This is the main online site for the nonprofit organization from Córdoba called Eco-Cuchas.

Their main goal is to provide temporary and environmentally friendly shelter to stray dogs in Córdoba and its outskirts while they manage their adoption.

# DISCLAIMER

This site was made by request, the design was provided by the organization and I was tasked to make it happen as a programmer, there is no other language rather than Spanish because they are a local organization. 

Nevertheless it works like a regular website, you may be able to translate its contents with the usual extension of your browser but for more information regarding the organization and its goals you may go to the section "Contacto" where the organization's main networks are avaiable.

## This was made using REACT JS.

The following scripts are the standarized version that comes along all React Apps.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
